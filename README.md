## Features

GitHub's built-in `gh` tool does not show inline comments, review threads, or thread grouping. This extension adds:

- View inline review threads with file context
- Reply to comments from the terminal
- Resolve threads programmatically
- Group and inspect threads with `threads view`
- Export structured JSON for LLMs and automation
- Manage pull request draft status (mark as draft/ready for review)
- List all draft pull requests in a repository
- Continuously monitor a PR and stream one event per change (`monitor`) — designed to be wrapped by [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)'s persistent `Monitor` tool for live, agent-driven PR notifications

## Installation

## Usage

Basic workflow:

1. Start a review: `gh monitor review --start`
2. Add comments: `gh monitor review --add-comment --review-id <ID> --path <file> --line <N> --body "<msg>"`
3. Submit review: `gh monitor review --submit --review-id <ID> --event APPROVE`
4. Resolve threads: `gh monitor threads resolve --thread-id <ID>`

### Adding Reactions

Add reactions to any GitHub node (comments, reviews, etc.):

```sh
gh monitor react <comment_id> --type thumbs_up
```

Valid reaction types: `thumbs_up`, `thumbs_down`, `laugh`, `hooray`, `confused`, `heart`, `rocket`, `eyes`

When inside a git repository, `-R owner/repo` and PR number are inferred automatically.

### Viewing Reviews

`gh monitor review view` shows all reviews, inline comments, and replies:

```sh
gh monitor review view -R owner/repo --pr 3
```

Common filters:

- `--unresolved` — Show only unresolved threads
- `--reviewer <user>` — Filter by reviewer
- `--states APPROVED,CHANGES_REQUESTED` — Filter by review state

Reply to threads using the `thread_id` from the view output:

```sh
gh monitor comments reply --thread-id <ID> --body "<msg>"
```

### Managing Threads

List and resolve threads:

```sh
# List unresolved threads
gh monitor threads list --unresolved

# List only your threads
gh monitor threads list --mine

# Resolve a thread
gh monitor threads resolve --thread-id <ID>

# View full conversation for specific threads
gh monitor threads view <thread_id> <thread_id>
```

### Managing Draft Status

Check and manage pull request draft status:

```sh
# Check if PR is a draft
gh monitor draft status --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# Mark PR as draft
gh monitor draft mark --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# Mark PR as ready for review
gh monitor draft ready --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# List all draft PRs in repository
gh monitor draft list --repo owner/repo
```

### Deleting Comments

Delete a comment from a pending review:

```sh
gh monitor review --delete-comment --comment-id <comment_id>
```

This only works on comments in pending reviews. Once a review is submitted, comments cannot be deleted.

### Monitoring a PR (streaming)

The default command — invoked as `gh monitor <selector> [flags]` without a subcommand — watches a PR continuously. The `monitor` and `watch` subcommands are also available as explicit forms.

`monitor` runs continuously and emits **one event per genuinely-new change** — new review threads, general comments, failing/green CI, merge conflicts, review decisions, new commits, and merge/close. Each event is one NDJSON line on stdout, so a persistent watcher can surface each line as it arrives. The loop auto-stops when the PR is merged or closed, and idle polling backs off exponentially (capped at 5 minutes).

```sh
# Default: stream events until the PR is merged/closed (NDJSON, one event per line)
gh monitor -R owner/repo 42                    # or: gh monitor monitor 42 -R owner/repo
gh monitor watch -R owner/repo 42              # alias for 'monitor'

# Human-readable rendered messages instead of JSON
gh monitor monitor --text -R owner/repo 42

# One-shot: emit the current actionable state and exit
gh monitor monitor --once -R owner/repo 42
```

**Monitor flags:**

- `--interval <seconds>` - Base polling interval (default: 60, min 10)
- `--timeout <seconds>` - Maximum watch time (default: 0 = until merged/closed)
- `--ignored-bots <a,b>` - Author logins whose general comments are ignored
- `--once` - Fetch once, emit the current actionable state, and exit
- `--text` - Emit the rendered message per event instead of NDJSON

`new-unresolved-threads` and `new-general-comments` events carry a rich `detail` body — the thread/comment location, author, text, a diff excerpt centered on the anchored line, and the exact commands to reply/resolve or 👍-acknowledge — so a consumer can act without extra API calls. In `--text` mode the PR label and commit SHA are wrapped in OSC-8 hyperlinks (clickable in supporting terminals, plain text elsewhere) and any `detail` body is printed, indented, beneath the message.

Set `retriggerComments: true` in the preferences file to re-emit every open unresolved thread and general comment on _each_ poll (instead of only genuinely-new ones). This is chatty and effectively disables the idle backoff, so pair it with a longer `--interval`. Check/CI/review/commit/state events still de-duplicate normally.

Notification wording is templated and user-overridable via `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/gh-monitor/preferences.json`. Use the [`prefs`](#managing-preferences) command to view and edit it without touching the file by hand.

#### Use with Claude Code

`monitor` is designed to be wrapped by [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)'s persistent `Monitor` tool: each NDJSON line becomes a session notification, so the agent reacts to review comments, CI failures, conflicts, and new commits as they happen. The command handles polling and change-detection; the harness handles delivery and turn-batching (events that arrive mid-turn are queued and flushed when the turn ends).

In practice you don't write the tool call yourself — you ask Claude Code in plain language, e.g.:

> Monitor PR 42 in this repo and address review comments as they come in.

Claude then registers a persistent monitor whose command is this tool:

```
Monitor({
  command: "gh monitor -R owner/repo 42",
  persistent: true,
  description: "PR owner/repo#42 events",
})
```

The watch runs in the background while Claude works, and **auto-stops** when the PR is merged or closed. To stop it earlier, tell Claude to stop monitoring (it calls `TaskStop`). Because 👍-acknowledged comments are dropped from the stream, the loop-breaker is: reply/fix, then resolve the thread or react 👍 — that item won't notify again.

See [docs/CLAUDE_CODE.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE.md) for the full guide, the event→reaction mapping, template customization, and a hook that auto-suggests monitoring right after `gh pr create`.

### Monitoring a workflow run

Use `--run-id <id>` to watch a **single GitHub Actions workflow run** until it reaches a terminal conclusion. This works for any non-PR run — deploy workflows on `main`, `workflow_dispatch` runs, scheduled runs, etc. — and is the counterpart to PR CI watching: instead of polling a PR for check suites, it polls the run's `status`/`conclusion` and emits one event per genuinely-new transition (`run-queued`, `run-in-progress`, `run-completed`). The loop **auto-stops** when the run's status becomes `completed`.

The run id is the numeric id in a run's URL: `…/actions/runs/<id>` (also `databaseId` from `gh run list`).

```sh
# Watch run 30433642 until it completes (NDJSON, one event per line)
gh monitor --run-id 30433642 -R owner/repo

# One-shot: emit the current state (e.g. a run already finished) and exit
gh monitor --run-id 30433642 -R owner/repo --once

# Human-readable rendered messages instead of JSON
gh monitor --run-id 30433642 -R owner/repo --text
```

The `run-completed` event carries the run's `conclusion` (`success`, `failure`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `neutral`, `action_required`, `stale`, `skipped`) as structured JSON, plus `run_id`, the run URL, and the head commit. The same `--interval`, `--timeout`, `--once`, `--text`, and `-R` flags apply. `--run-id` is mutually exclusive with the PR selector and `--ref`/`--commit`/`--issue`.

### Managing preferences

`gh monitor prefs` views and edits the notification templates and config stored in `~/.config/gh-monitor/preferences.json` (the legacy `~/.config/gh-pr-monitor/preferences.json` is read as a fallback). Editing via `prefs` always writes to the canonical path, so it migrates a legacy config on first use.

```sh
# Print the effective preferences (built-in defaults merged with file overrides)
gh monitor prefs            # or: gh monitor prefs get

# Merge overrides and save (a null template resets that key to its default)
gh monitor prefs set '{"templates":{"conflict":"⚠️ {prLabel} conflict!"}}'
gh monitor prefs set '{"templates":{"merged":null},"ignoredBots":["dependabot"]}'

# Read overrides from a file or stdin
gh monitor prefs set --file overrides.json
echo '{"retriggerComments":true}' | gh monitor prefs set --file -

# Reset everything to the built-in defaults
gh monitor prefs reset

# Show the preferences file path
gh monitor prefs path
```

The document shape is `{ "templates": {"<event-kind>": "<template>" | null}, "ignoredBots": ["login", …], "retriggerComments": false }`. Event kinds and template tokens are listed in `gh monitor prefs --help`. A `--config-dir <dir>` flag overrides the config location (handy for testing).

### Additional Flags

**Review start:**

- `--commit <sha>` - Pin the pending review to a specific commit (defaults to current head)

**Add comment:**

- `--side <LEFT|RIGHT>` - Diff side for inline comment (default: RIGHT)
- `--start-line <n>` - Start line for multi-line comments
- `--start-side <LEFT|RIGHT>` - Start side for multi-line comments

**Comments reply:**

- `--review-id <ID>` - GraphQL review identifier when replying inside a pending review
